# Car Automobile Components Dashboard

This project is a dashboard application built with Plotly Dash that visualizes the relationship between the type of drive wheels and the average price of different car body styles. The dashboard provides an interactive interface to explore these relationships using pie and bar charts.

## Project Explanation

The dashboard reads data from a CSV file containing information about various automobiles, including their drive wheels, body style, and price. Users can select a type of drive wheels (rear-wheel drive, front-wheel drive, or four-wheel drive) from a dropdown menu, and the dashboard will display:

- A pie chart showing the proportion of different body styles for the selected drive wheels type.
- A bar chart showing the average price of different body styles for the selected drive wheels type.

### Data Source

The automobile data used in this dashboard is sourced from the `automobileEDA.csv` file, which contains information about various car attributes.

### Key Features

- Interactive dropdown menu to select the type of drive wheels.
- Pie chart displaying the proportion of body styles for the selected drive wheels type.
- Bar chart displaying the average price of body styles for the selected drive wheels type.
