# Chicago SQL Data Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook project involves performing SQL-based data analysis on a dataset related to the city of Chicago. The analysis includes querying and manipulating data using SQL within a Python environment, leveraging libraries such as pandas and sqlite3 to identify which schools have the best attendance in the city of Chicago.

## Project Explanation

The notebook demonstrates the following:

1. **Data Loading**: Loading data into a SQLite database.
2. **Data Querying**: Executing various SQL queries to explore and analyze the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing the results of SQL queries using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.

### Key Features

- **SQL Integration**: Direct execution of SQL queries within the Jupyter Notebook using the sqlite3 library.
- **Data Analysis**: Performing complex data analysis tasks, including aggregation, filtering, and joining tables.
- **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the query results to derive insights.

### Data Source

The data used in this project pertains to various aspects of the city of Chicago, such as demographics, public services, or infrastructure. The data is stored in a SQLite database for efficient querying and manipulation.
