# Data Analysis Projects Repository

This repository contains various data analysis projects that I completed as part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certification. Each project showcases different aspects of data analysis, including data processing, visualization, and interpretation, using a variety of tools and techniques.

## Projects

### 1. US Domestic Airline Flights Performance Dashboard

This project involves creating a dashboard application using Plotly Dash to display various performance metrics and delay statistics for US domestic airlines from 2005 to 2020. The dashboard provides insights into airline performance, including cancellation rates, average flight times, diverted airport landings, and delays due to various causes.
